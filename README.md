FirstHand
=========

FirstHand was created to address the need for a smarter, more flexible astronaut's glove. The current space glove presents many challenges, including comfort, hand injuries, and the ability to receive input and provide feedback.

The FirstHand system is composed of two layers of fabric, five fingertip thermal sensors, copper strips that can be heated and cooled, and an Intel Edison-based thermostat mounted to the forearm. We also built a companion Android app able to control the system via simple gestures and voice commands.

We hope that FirstHand can contribute to the ongoing research goal of improving humanity's future in space.
